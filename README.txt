Hey, Kane here. 

This is my repository, what im trying to do is learn various coding languages that will aid me on my journey to becoming a better Cyber Security Engineer. 

I plan to follow a structured routine of learning Python and Powershell currently, but from there, once I am comfortable with them both, I would also like to learn Bash, GraphQL etc. 

this README file shall be used to periodically keep updates to various projects, but I also may create a seperate folder, documenting my experience with learning to code too within the "Coding" repo... 

Stay tuned!
